      A Narrative can be any scenario spanning any timeline.
      It represents a story that can take place over a certain period of time, or multiple points in time.
      In a Narrative, there are characters that comprise the story and they can be played by any user.
    </p>
    <p>
      When participating in a Narrative, there are two types of text one can enter: Narration and Dialogue. They should
      be used for their appropriate usage, that is, Narration as commentary through a point of view (usually third-person),
      and Dialogue specifically for speaking within the story. While technically Narration text can be used for speech,
      that is not the intended usage. Though there are times when it is necessary. Please use your best judgement to maintain
      immersion and structure for the Narrative.
    </p>
    <p> Please keep in mind that the creator has full control of the text contributed to the Narrative. They
    may edit or delete text that other users post. </p>
